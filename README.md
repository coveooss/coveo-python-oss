# coveo-python-oss

This repository is a collection of useful, general-purpose python libraries made by Coveo.


## Conventions and rules (aka The Boilerplateâ„¢)

A boilerplate is provided in `/coveo-example-library`. Just copy/rename and adjust for profit.
Take the time to read and understand [its readme](/coveo-example-library/README.md) before adding your first project as it contains the rules and conventions used in each project.


## For developers

A dev environment is provided at `/pyproject.toml` which aggregates all the projects into one convenient virtual environment. 
Refer to the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/) if you're new to poetry.

You can also use each project's individual environment, which has the added benefit of making sure
that all dependencies were correctly declared in the `pyproject.toml` file.

The CI process tests each project in isolation; it does not use the dev environment.
