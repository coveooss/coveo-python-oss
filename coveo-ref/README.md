Refactorable mock targets

## Demo

Consider this common piece of code:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

@patch("mymodule.clients.APIClient._do_request")
def test(api_client_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    ...
```

Because the mock target is a string, it makes it difficult to move things around without breaking the tests. You need a
tool that can extract the string representation of a python objet. This is what `ref` was built for:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from coveo_ref import ref
from mymodule.clients import APIClient

@patch(*ref(APIClient._do_request))
def test(api_client_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    ...
```

ðŸš€ This way, you can rename or move `mymodule`, `clients`, `APIClient` or even `_do_request`, and your IDE should find
these and adjust them just like any other reference in your project.

Let's examine a more complex example:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from mymodule.tasks import process

@patch("mymodule.tasks.get_api_client")
def test(get_api_client_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    assert process() is None  # pretend this tests the process function
```

The interesting thing in this example is that we're mocking `get_api_client` in the `tasks` module. 
Let's take a look at the `tasks` module:

```python
from typing import Optional
from mymodule.clients import get_api_client

def process() -> Optional[bool]:
    client = get_api_client()
    return ...
```

As we can see, `get_api_client` is defined in another module.
The test needs to patch the function _in the tasks module_ since that's the context it will be called from. 
Unfortunately, inspecting `get_api_client` from the `tasks` module at runtime leads us back to `mymodule.clients`.

This single complexity means that hardcoding the context `mymodule.tasks` and symbol `get_api_client` into a string
for the patch is the straightforward solution.

But with `ref`, you specify the context separately:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from coveo_ref import ref
from mymodule.clients import get_api_client
from mymodule.tasks import process


@patch(*ref(get_api_client, context=process))
def test(get_api_client_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    assert process() is None  # pretend this tests the process function
```

ðŸš€ By giving a context to `ref`, the symbol `get_api_client` will be resolved from the context of `process`, which is the
`mymodule.tasks` module. The result is `mymodule.tasks.get_api_client`.

If either objects (`get_api_client` or `process`) are moved or renamed using a refactoring tool, the mock will still
point to the correct name and context.

ðŸš€ And a nice bonus is that your IDE can jump to `get_api_client`'s definition from the test file now!

It should be noted that this isn't just some string manipulation. `ref` will import and inspect modules and objects
to make sure that they're correct. Here's a more complex case with a renamed symbol:

The module:

```python
from typing import Optional
from mymodule.clients import get_api_client as client_factory  # it got renamed! ðŸ˜±

def process() -> Optional[bool]:
    client = client_factory()
    return ...
```

The test:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from coveo_ref import ref
from mymodule.clients import get_api_client
from mymodule.tasks import process


@patch(*ref(get_api_client, context=process))
def test(get_api_client_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    assert process() is None  # pretend this tests the process function
```

Notice how the test and patch did not change despite the renamed symbol?

ðŸš€ This is because `ref` will find `get_api_client` as `client_factory` when inspecting `mymodule.tasks` module,
and return `mymodule.tasks.client_factory`.

We can also use ref with `patch.object()` in order to patch a single instance. Consider the following code:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch
from mymodule.clients import APIClient

def test() -> None:
    client = APIClient()
    with patch.object(client, "_do_request"):
        ...
```

ðŸš€ By specifying `obj=True` to `ref`, you will obtain a `Tuple[instance, attribute_to_patch_as_a_string]` that you
can unpack to `patch.object()`:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch
from coveo_ref import ref
from mymodule.clients import APIClient

def test() -> None:
    client = APIClient()
    with patch.object(*ref(client._do_request, obj=True)):
        ...
```

Please refer to the docstring of `ref` for argument usage information.

## Common Mock Recipes

### Mock something globally without context
#### Option 1: by leveraging the import mechanism

To mock something globally without regards for the context, it has to be accessed through a dot `.` by the context.

For instance, consider this test:

```python
from http.client import HTTPResponse
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from coveo_ref import ref

from mymodule.tasks import process


@patch(*ref(HTTPResponse.close))
def test(http_response_close_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    assert process()
```

The target is `HTTPResponse.close`, which lives in the `http.client` module.
The contextof the test is the `process` function, which lives in the `mymodule.tasks` module.
Let's take a look at `mymodule.tasks`'s source code:


```python
from http import client

def process() -> bool:
    _ = client.HTTPResponse(...)  # of course this is fake, but serves the example
    return ...
```

Since `mymodule.tasks` reaches `HTTPResponse` through a dot (i.e.: `client.HTTPResponse`), we can patch `HTTPResponse`
without using `mymodule.tasks` as the context.

However, if `mymodule.tasks` was written like this:

```python
from http.client import HTTPResponse

def process() -> bool:
    _ = HTTPResponse(...)
    return ...
```

Then the patch would not affect the object used by the `process` function anymore. However, it would affect any other 
module that uses the dot to reach `HTTPResponse` since the patch was _still_ applied globally.
 

#### Option 2: By wrapping a hidden function

Another approach to mocking things globally is to hide a function behind another, and mock the hidden function.
This allows modules to use whatever import style they want, and the mocks become straightforward to setup.

Pretend this is `mymodule.clients`:

```python
class APIClient:
    ...

def get_api_client() -> APIClient:
    return _get_api_client()

def _get_api_client() -> APIClient:
    return APIClient()
```

And this is `mymodule.tasks`:

```python
from mymodule.clients import get_api_client

def process() -> bool:
    return get_api_client() is not None
```

So you _know_ this works globally, because no one will (should?) import the private one except the test:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from coveo_ref import ref

from mymodule.tasks import process
from mymodule.clients import _get_api_client


@patch(*ref(_get_api_client))
def test(api_client_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    assert process()
```


### Mock something for a given context

When you want to mock something for a given module, you must provide a hint to `ref` as the `context` argument.

The hint may be a module, or a function/class defined within that module. "Defined" here means that "def" or "class" 
was used _in that module_. If the hint was imported into the module, it will not work:

`mymodule.tasks`:

```python
from mymodule.clients import get_api_client

def process() -> bool:
    client = get_api_client()
    return ...
```

The test, showing 3 different methods that work:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from coveo_ref import ref

from mymodule.clients import get_api_client
from mymodule.tasks import process

# you can pass the module as the context
import mymodule

@patch(*ref(get_api_client, context=mymodule.tasks))
def test(get_api_client_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    assert process()

# you can pass the module as the context, version 2
from mymodule import tasks
    
@patch(*ref(get_api_client, context=tasks))
def test(get_api_client_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    assert process()

# you can also pass a function or a class defined in the `tasks` module
from mymodule.tasks import process
@patch(*ref(get_api_client, context=process))
def test(get_api_client_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    assert process()
```

The 3rd method is encouraged: provide the function or class that is actually using the `get_api_client` import.
In our example, that's the `process` function.
If `process` was ever moved to a different module, it would carry the `get_api_client` import, and the mock would
be automatically adjusted to target `process`'s new module without changes.

### Mock something for the current context

Sometimes, the test file _is_ the context. When that happens, just pass `__name__` as the context:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch
from coveo_ref import ref
from mymodule.clients import get_api_client, APIClient

def _prepare_test() -> APIClient:
    client = get_api_client()
    ...
    return client
    
@patch(*ref(get_api_client, context=__name__))
def test() -> None:
    client = _prepare_test()
    ...
```


### Mock a method on a class

Since a method cannot be imported and can only be accessed through the use of a dot `.` on a class or instance, 
you can always patch methods globally:

```python
with patch(*ref(MyClass.fn)): ...
```

This is because no module can import `fn`; it has to go through an import of `MyClass`.

### Mock a method on one instance of a class

Simply add `obj=True` and use `patch.object()`:

```python
with patch.object(*ref(instance.fn, obj=True)): ...
```


### Mock an attribute on a class/instance/module/function/object/etc

`ref` cannot help with this task:
- You cannot refer an attribute that exists (you would pass the value, not a reference)
- You cannot refer an attribute that doesn't exist (because it doesn't exist!)

For this, there's no going around hardcoding the attribute name in a string:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.a = 1


def test_attr() -> None:
    instance = MyClass()
    with patch.object(instance, "a", new=2):
        assert instance.a == 2
        assert MyClass().a == 1
```

This sometimes work when patching **instances**. 
The example works because `a` is a simple attribute that lives in `instance.__dict__` and `patch.object` knows
about that.

But if you tried to patch `MyClass` instead of `instance`, `mock.patch` would complain that there's no 
such thing as `a` over there.
Thus, patching an attribute globally will most likely result in a lot of wasted time, and should be avoided.

There's no way to make the example work with `ref` because there's no way to refer `instance.a` without actually
getting the value of `a`, unless we hardcode a string, which defeats the purpose of `ref` completely.


### Mock a property

You can only patch a property globally, through its class:

```python
class MyClass:
    @property
    def get(self) -> bool:
        return False
```

```python
from unittest.mock import PropertyMock, patch, MagicMock
from coveo_ref import ref

from mymodule import MyClass

@patch(*ref(MyClass.get), new_callable=PropertyMock, return_value=True)
def test(my_class_get_mock: MagicMock) -> None:
    assert MyClass().get == True
    my_class_get_mock.assert_called_once()
```

You **cannot** patch a property on an instance, this is a limitation of `unittest.mock` because of the way
properties work.
If you try, `mock.patch.object()` will complain that the property is read only.


### Mock a classmethod or staticmethod on a specific instance

When inspecting these special methods on an instance, `ref` ends up finding the class instead of the instance.

Therefore, `ref` is unable to return a `Tuple[instance, function_name]`.
It would return `Tuple[class, function_name]`, resulting in a global patch. ðŸ˜±

But `ref` will detect this mistake, and will raise a helpful exception if it cannot return an instance when you
specified `obj=True`.

For this particular scenario, the workaround is to provide the instance as the context:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch
from coveo_ref import ref


class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def get() -> bool:
        return False

    
def test() -> None:
    instance = MyClass()
    with patch.object(*ref(instance.get, context=instance, obj=True)) as fn_mock:
        assert instance.get == True
        assert MyClass().get == False  # new instances are not affected by the object mock
        fn_mock.assert_called_once()
```

Some may prefer a more semantically-correct version by specifying the target through the class instead of the 
instance. In the end, these are all equivalent:

```python
with patch.object(instance, "get"): 
    ...

with patch.object(*ref(instance.get, context=instance, obj=True)): 
    ...

with patch.object(*ref(MockClass.get, context=instance, obj=True)): 
    ...
```

In this case, the version without ref is much shorter and arguably more pleasant for the eye, but `get` can no longer
be renamed without altering the tests.
